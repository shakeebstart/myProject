  If you’ve ever signed up for a complex SaaS product, there’s a good chance you’ve seen demo content without realizing it.

  SaaS businesses use demo content because they know that it’s incredibly demoralizing for customers to get excited about using a new product, only to find that there’s no existing data on the site that would lead them to understand the value of the product faster.
  
  The value of demo content is perhaps most apparent for early-stage SaaS products with few users, or for products where the value is directly correlated with the presence of other users, such as a social network.
  
  But where do you get demo data from? How do you use it transparently and ethically? And why does it matter?
  
  Read on to find out.

  TL;DR
  Demo content is made-up placeholder data that shows customers how a given product could be used for their specific use case.
  It’s often used to fill empty states, for internal product testing purposes, on sales calls, or to facilitate self-serve sales.
  It’s wise to create different demo content for different customer segments, and to ensure that the content is as educational as possible.
  Avoid using real user data in your demo content (think privacy!), but make sure that users know that it’s based on dummy data and that it’s easy to replace with their real data.
  Make sure your dummy dataset is large enough so that users can look at conclusions that they find meaningful for their particular use case, and then imagine what these conclusions might look like for their own, real dataset.
  You can create dummy content for your demo by using synthetic data, public APIs, or open-source databases filled with fake user profiles. You should never have to make up this data yourself from scratch or they may not make sense!
  If you need a versatile tool that will cover most of your customer education bases, give Userpilot a try.
  What is demo content?
  Let’s start with some basic definitions.
  
  Demonstration content, or “demo content” for short, is made-up, placeholder customer data that businesses show to users in order to demonstrate a product use case that is relevant to them.
  
  For example:
  
  Made up project data for a project management tool
  Made up sales call data for a sales CRM tool
  Made up browsing data for an analytics tool
  Demo content is valuable for SaaS products for two main reasons:
  
  1. To see if your product works
  For example, if you were testing an online course platform that you built, you’d need to put in some dummy users before being able to show it to real customers.
  
  It would be foolish indeed to expose your online course site to customers if they were unable to register on it due to a technical issue — one that you could have easily discovered through testing it.
  
  2.To sell your product
  Buyers want to see how something works before they buy it, and this is especially true online. A demo can be sales-led or self-service.
  
  Most often, demo content is shown to users when they first sign up for a particular SaaS product, or during sales calls.
  
  In both instances, the thinking is that it would be harder for a new user to really experience the “Aha Moment” without seeing how the product works in a practical sense — complete with real data.
  
  On sales calls, the salesperson is able to harness the demo content to illustrate to the customer what they can expect from using the product. We actually do this at Userpilot as well by using a dummy product called Campfire.
